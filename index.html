<h1>Customizable picture frame</h1>
<p>Enter the dimensions of the picture in centimeters.
    <br/>There's a 5mm margin all around (on the inside of the frame) included.
    <br/>It's recommended to use a maximum of one decimal (so by increments of 0.1cm).
    <br/>The maximum size is based on the print bed size: you can generate a frame in 4 parts if the length doesn't
    exceed the print bed size (at 45 degrees), otherwise parts will be split in half (so 8 parts in total).
    <br/>For example, on a 20x20cm print bed, the maximum frame size is 27*2 = 52cm.

<h2>Printing instructions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A ZIP file will be created, it contains 2 or 4 pieces (depending on the size and the size of the printer)
        generated to your dimensions and a file for the nail.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the pieces in your slicer software. Duplicate the nail as many times as needed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Simplify3D will show an alert about the scale of the nail being wrong, you can ignore it (do not resize).
        <br>If you need to change the size of the nail manually, it's a rectangle with a length of 9mm and a side of
        2.7mm
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>This print requires a layer height of 0.2mm or less</li>
    <br>
    <li>Use 5 top and bottom layers, and 2-3 perimeter shells. I found an 8% infill is a good compromise (using an
        hexagonal pattern).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Temperature is quite important here as the tolerances are very small.
        <br>Overheating the filament / bed will result in distortion, and pieces might not fit correctly.
        <br>I get good results when using PLA at 190C with hairspray on glass - bed heating is recommended to avoid
        distortion. I use 50C on the first 6 layers.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Print this set twice.</li>
    <br>
    <li>When removing the pieces from the bed, lift them from their square side (angled corners are more fragile and can
        easily break).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Depending on the material, it might be better to glue the parts, or not use the nails at all.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Make sure you have the assembly ready before adding the nails. Once put in place, you won't be able to remove
        them.
    </li>
</ul>
