<h1>Customizable picture frame</h1>
<p>Enter the dimensions of the picture in centimeters. There's a 5mm margin all around (on the inside of the frame). You can use one decimal (so by increments of 0.1cm).</p>

<h2>Printing instructions</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>A ZIP file will be created, it contains 4 pieces generated to your dimensions and a file for the nail.
    </li><br>
    <li>Add the 4 pieces in your 3D printer software. Duplicate the nail 3 times.</li><br>
    <li>Simplify3D will show an alert about the scale of the nail being wrong, you can ignore it (do not resize).
        <br>If you need to change the size of the nail manually, it's a rectangle with a length of 9mm and a side of 2.7mm</li><br>
    <li>This print requires a layer height of 0.2mm or less</li><br>
    <li>You can print it as hollow as 8%, below that prints might fail.</li><br>
    <li>Use 5 top and bottom layers, and 5 perimeter shells</li><br>
    <li>Temperature is quite important here as the tolerances are very small.
        <br>Overheating the filament / bed will result in distortion, and pieces might not fit corrrectly.
        <br>I get good results when using PLA at 190C with hairspray on glass (without bed heating).
    </li><br>
    <li>Print this set twice.</li><br>
    <li>When removing the pieces from the bed, lift them from their square side (the angled corners are more fragile).
    </li><br>
    <li>Make sure you have the assembly ready before adding the nails. Once put in place, you won't be able to remove
        them.
    </li>
</ul>
